# foodfeed
Foodfeed project - An android project on food sharing/selling with social network elements.

- This project is the senior project that me and my team build at Computer Engineering Department, METU. I specifically worked on Android part of the project while rest of our team worked on back-end and web application. We got 3rd place at Senior Projects Competition, CENG Demoday2016, METU. 

- Foodfeed project is a food network where users can share/sell their meals that they prepare at home. There are also social elements in this network so that you can follow the cooks that you like, send messages, set up meetings and so on.

- Things to add to the project:
  - Unit and instrumantation tests.
  - Code rewamp and cleaning.
